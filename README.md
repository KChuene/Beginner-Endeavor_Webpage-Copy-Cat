# Beginner-Endeavor_Webpage-Copy-Cat
CSS, HTML

As a newbie to CSS and HTML, I attempt to excercise these newly found muscles by searching the web for interesting web pages and attempt to make copies of them using just these newly found muscles.

Copied organisations'/companies' home pages include:
1. Blender Foundation
2. Unity Technologies
